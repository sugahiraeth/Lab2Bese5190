### Modifications implemented:
As per our project proposal we implemented a morse code signal generated which drove an LED based on character received by the serial input and translated by the C program running onboard the RP2040 QTpy. We implemented this using pio later on and both drove an LED and printed the result of the transaction. We made sub-functions for printing dots and dashes.
